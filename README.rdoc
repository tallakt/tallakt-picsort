= tallakt-picsort

A script to move image files to folders with the same name as image date

= Example

  picsort --base /my/picture/folder/ temp/folder/*.jpg /temp/folder/*.cr2

The script will look at the EXIF information in each image file ad determine
the name of the folder where it should reside.

This works much like the Canon USB import driver on windows
